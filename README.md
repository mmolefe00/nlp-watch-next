# Watch Next - Natural Language Processing

## Project Description
This task uses Natural Language Processing and functions to read an external text file, movies.txt, and compares the movie descriptions in the file to a sample description: Planet Hulk. 
The movie that is most similar in description is then outputted to the user as a watch next suggestion.

## Instructions
* Import the repository to your device.
* Ensure all files are in the same directory/file location - especially watch_next.py and movies.txt if you have no intention of viewing the container.
* In your ide, eg. VS code or Pycharm, open both files.
* Ensure that the movies.txt has movie data in it.
* Run the watch_next.py file and the suggested movie will be outputted to you.
* NOTE: the script requires SpaCy to function properly. Ensure that this is importable to your ide.

Thank you!
